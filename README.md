#Social Features
The theme is integrated with Disqus, Google+, Facebook and Twitter so your visitors can directly share your posts with no extra hassle. We’ve also added the ‘Like’ and ‘Reblog’ buttons directly into every post making it easy to interact with your posts.

#Responsive
The theme is fully responsive and should function nicely and adjust its layout regardless of the device you’re on. If you are using the ‘Sidebar’ layout but viewing on a smaller display, the layout will automatically default to the fail-safe of the ‘Header’ on-top. For all smaller devices, if you have uploaded an logo, it’ll automatically be scaled down or fallback on the non-retina version.
